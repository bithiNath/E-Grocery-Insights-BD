## 📌 About

Bangladesh's e-grocery sector is experiencing rapid growth, driven by factors such as bulk purchase discounts, exclusive product offers, free delivery above certain order thresholds, and the convenience of time-saving shopping. These incentives are reshaping how urban consumers purchase daily essentials. However, with multiple platforms offering varying prices, brands, and deals, consumers often struggle to identify where they can save the most. This project bridges that gap by scraping real-time grocery data from two major e-grocery sources in Bangladesh, enabling a data-driven comparison at the sub-category and brand level.
Rather than direct product matching, this project focuses on market-level trends to uncover:
- Which platform and product sub-categories offer the most savings
- How brand availability differs across platforms
- How offers vary by product size and price segment
- Which top 10 brands dominate by product listing on each platform
- Which platform offers lower prices across all products and regularly purchased items of common brands, analyzed by price segment and category
  

### 🔍 Scope
- Platforms covered: **Chaldal** and **Shwapno**
- Data collection method: **Dynamic web scraping** using Selenium
- Total product listings: **7,197** (Chaldal: 3,337 | Shwapno: 3,860)
- Total unique brands identified: **~700**
- Data collected: **Late March 2026**

### ⚠️ Limitations
- **~890 duplicate** entries, including a few null values, were removed during cleaning.
- **~350 products** appearing in multiple sub-categories were cleaned by retaining only the listing under their most relevant sub-category.
- The same product may appear with different prices or unit sizes, as pricing and packaging vary across platforms.
- Brand names were extracted from product titles using keyword frequency analysis, followed by manual correction — resulting in **~700 unique brands** identified.
- **~4,000 products** had generic units (pcs, each, pack, etc.), so an `Extra_info` column was extracted from titles to determine actual unit, `offer_status`, `Total_savings`, `Actual_unit_price`, and `Market_price`.
- Out-of-stock status on Chaldal could not be scraped, so such few products remain in the dataset and may slightly bias the results.

## 🎯 Future Goals
- Incorporate statistical analysis on the existing dataset
- Automate scraping with scheduled runs to track price changes over time
- Conduct seasonal analysis (e.g., Ramadan, Eid effects) and visualize through Power BI
- Expand to more e-grocery platforms for broader market comparison
